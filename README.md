## Description

As UC San Diego CSE students, when we conduct our research project, we realized that there was no easy-to-use web scrapers for CAPES (UCSD classes statistics websites) and RateMyProfessor. As a result, we built a sample webscrapers for these two websites and could be easily modified to get other schools' data. We also wrote a sample data analysis project which utilized the web scrapers we built to show how to easily use and apply them to students' own research projects.

## Getting Started
